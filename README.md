# Welcome to Urban Analytics!

With the increase of data availability and the computing power together with advanced data analytics, the data driven approach becomes a more objective and scientific way for us to understand the urban system for solving the social, economic, and environmental challenges in cities. Knowledge and skills for collecting and analyzing urban spatial data become an essential skill for urban researchers. This course will teach students the concepts, techniques, and analytical methods for urban analytics. Methods for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing various types of urban data using programming will be taught in this course. Examples of real urban analytics applications will be introduced in this course in order for students to get the practical skills in handling urban spatial data. The course is designed for students who have programming experience or have finished GUS 5031 (GIS Programming) previously and want to reinforce the knowledge and skills and learn advanced topics in urban informatics and urban data analytics for solving urban issues. This course includes lectures and lab exercises. The knowledge and skills learned in this course further prepare students for an emerging career in smart city, data science, GIS, urban planning, and environmental management.
